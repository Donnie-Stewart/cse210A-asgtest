# CSE201A HW4 While-SS

To run this project: 

1. Clone the repo or download the source code.

2. Switch into the homework 4 folder using the command `cd cse210A-asgtest-hw4-whiless`

3. Run the test cases with the command `./test.sh`. This will run makefile which will download pyinstaller onto your computer, make an executable callled while, and then run the test cases.

4. To delete the `while-ss` executable, you can run the command `make clean`

The screenshots of the expected behavior can be found under `HW4-Output.pdf`

The git logs for this project are under the `Git_log` file. 

NOTE: This homework builds off homework 1, which which the tutorial linked [here](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part7/) was used. It comes reccomended by Prof Flanagan and Sherry, the TA. Surya and Donnie worked together on this homework.

### NOTE TO SHERRY: 

We commented out the test cases we are failing so the output is screenshotable and also so your terminal is not bombarded with code. We are failing the following test cases:

Easy: 17
Medium: 1, 2, 9, 10 

These test scripts are prepared based on [Sohum Banerjea's work](https://github.com/SohumB/cse210A-asgtest/tree/master).
