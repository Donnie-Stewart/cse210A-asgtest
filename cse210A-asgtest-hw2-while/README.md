# CSE201A HW2 While

To run this project: 

1. Clone the repo or download the source code.

2. Switch into the homework 2 folder using the command `cd cse210A-asgtest-hw2-while`

3. Run the test cases with the command `./test.sh`. This will run makefile which will download pyinstaller onto your computer, make an executable callled while, and then run the test cases.

4. To just run while.py, use the command `make main`. 

5. To delete the `while` executable, you can run the command `make clean`

The screenshots of the expected behavior can be found under `HW2 Output.pdf`

The git logs for this project are under the `Git_log` file. 

NOTE: This homework builds off homework 1, which which the tutorial linked [here](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part7/) was used. It comes reccomended by Prof Flanagan and Sherry, the TA. Surya and Donnie worked together on this homework. We both did homework1 independently so for this assignment we just worked off Donnie's assignment 1.

These test scripts are prepared based on [Sohum Banerjea's work](https://github.com/SohumB/cse210A-asgtest/tree/master).
