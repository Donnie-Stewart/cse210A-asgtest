To run arith against the test script you could either clone the repo from github or download the source code.
This is the github link:
  git@github.com:Donnie-Stewart/cse210A-asgtest.git
Source submitted on canvas.

Next, run ./test.sh in terminal while within the "/cse210A-asgtest-hw1-arith/" directory and it will pass the 35 available tests.
It does this by using pyinstaller to create an executable called arith to run all of the test cases with.

Cleaning unnecessary files can be done with a Make clean call.

In creating this project I used the tutorial from the syllabus for inspiration and methodology.

Additionally, I worked with Surya Keswani on the Makefile. We would also discuss some high level parts of the project.
This includes, basic AST and concepts from the course.
